This is a disassembly of Pokémon Red.

It uses the following ROM as a base:
Pokemon Red (UE) [S][!].gb
(MD5: 3d45c1ee9abd5738df46d2bdda8b57dc)

To assemble, first install RGBDS and put it in your path.

The version of RGBDS needed is rgbds-linux:
https://github.com/bentley/rgbds/
git://github.com/bentley/rgbds.git

Then copy the Pokémon ROM to this directory as "baserom.gbc".
Then run "make" in your shell.

This will output a file named "pokered.gbc".
